Course [Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://www.udacity.com/course/object-oriented-programming-in-java--ud283)

This folder contain every piece of code that was asked (or not) to be created at the course. They're numbered according to the order they were presented on the course.

## Relevant Projects
The relevant projects are:
* 5-HangmanForMovies
* 10-MissionToMars

They both contain the description given on the course so anyone can review the code (I'd appreciate that).
